abstract = {Multi-source heterogeneous information fusion in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a type of information processing that attempts to provide a comprehensive, timely and accurate perception and feedback relative to physical things. Traditional multi-sensor data fusion can deal with the same type of data effectively. However, as new characteristics emerge in the IoT, interoperable service-oriented technologies are required to share real-world data among heterogeneous devices to integrate and fuse the multi-source heterogeneous IoT data. To address these issues, an architecture that can provide guidance for the development of IoT information fusion is required. We compare features of IoT data and information with an existing wireless sensor network and the Internet, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comparison of this kind. Then, we design a framework for multi-source heterogeneous information fusion in the IoT and use an experimental simulation platform to build an environmental monitoring system to assess the framework.},

abstract = {Recently much emphasize is given on integrating Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructures to support the execution of various latency sensitive and computing intensive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although different real-world frameworks attempt to assist such integration, they have limitations in respect of platform independence, security, resource management and multi-application execution. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, named FogBus that facilitates end-to-end IoT-Fog(Edge)-Cloud integration. FogBus offers platform independent interfaces to IoT applications and computing instances for execution and interaction. It not only assists developers to build applications but also helps users to run multiple applications at a time and service providers to manage their resources. Moreover, FogBus applies Blockchain, authentication and encryption techniques to secure operations on sensitive data. Due to its simplified and cross platform software systems, it is easy to deploy, scalable and cost efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FogBus by creating a computing environment with it that integrates finger pulse oximeters as IoT devices with Smartphone-based gateway and Raspberry Pi-based Fog nodes for Sleep Apnea analysis. We also evaluate the characteristics of FogBus in respect of other existing frameworks and the impact of various FogBus settings on system parameters through deployment of a real-world IoT application. The experimental results show that FogBus is comparatively lightweight and responsive, and different FogBus settings can tune the computing environment as per the situation demands.},

delivered, and assessed according to the application objectives. The way these data
are manipulated by the sensor nodes is a fundamental issue. Information fusion arises
as a response to process data gathered by sensor nodes and benefits from their processing
capability. By exploiting the synergy among the available data, information fusion
techniques can reduce the amount of data traffic, filter noisy measurements, and make
predictions and inferences about a monitored entity. In this work, we survey the current
state-of-the-art of information fusion by presenting the known methods, algorithms,
architectures, and models of information fusion, and discuss their applicability in

With the emergence of smart city, plethora of data sources have been made available for wide variety of applications. The common technique for handling multiple data sources is data fusion, where it improves data output quality or extracts knowledge from the raw data. In order to cater evergrowing highly complicated applications, studies in smart city have to utilize data from various sources and evaluate their performance based on multiple aspects. To this end, we introduce a multi-perspectives classification of the data fusion to evaluate the smart city applications. Moreover, we applied the proposed multi-perspectives classification to evaluate selected applications in each domain of the smart city. We conclude the paper by discussing potential future direction and challenges of data fusion integration.},
